In this case study, I am going to analyze smart device data to gain insight into how customers use their smart devices which will help guide marketing strategy for the company.  \n\n## Ask\n\n### Business Task\n\n#### Guiding questions:\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?  \n\nThe task is to analyse non-Bellabeat smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how customers use their smart devices.  \n\n## Prepare\n\n### Data Sources Used:\n\nFitbit Fitness Tracker Data(CCO:Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore usersâ€™ habits.  \n\n#### Data Integrity:\n**Reliable**- Yes\n**Original**- Yes\n**Comprehensive**- No. Data is taken from only 30 users and consists information from a mere 1 month, which is not enough to make accurate conclusions.\n**Current**- No. Data is collected from 4/12/2016 to 5/12/2016\n**Cited**- Yes\n\n## Process\n\nI will be using R for this case study today as I will be able to clean, analyse and create visualization in the same platform.  \n\nFirst, I will be installing and loading all the packages I need.

I was surprised to find that on the weekend again, similar to calories burnt, people sleep a more consistent 5-9 hours.    \n\n### Summary:\n1. People tend not to log in their weight.\n2. Most users walk 4-8000 steps a day. A low percentage walk less than 4000 and the rest walk more than 8000 steps.\n3. More than half of the users meet CDC guidelines for weekly activity.\n4. Calories burnt during the week were a pretty consistent 1500-4000 on Saturday and Sunday and a little spread out during the weekdays with some highs seen on Thursday and Friday although the correlation should be taken with a grain of salt.\n5. Users tend to sleep between 5-9 hrs every night and our data did not show much of a correlation with intensity of exercise.\n6. Data also did not show much of a correlation between days of the week and sleep besides hours of sleep being a more consistent 5-9hrs on the weekend and a slightly downward trend around the weekend compared to the rest of the week.\n\n## Act\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. Users tend not to log in their weight on the Fitness Tracker. Perhaps giving people easier options of logging in weight like a way to sync with a weighing machine or reminders to log in weight at certain intervals would act as an advantage in the Bellabeat app and Leaf, especially for customers who have weight loss goals.\n2. Since most users have a healthy step count, they might be tracking them on a regular basis and may be setting stepping goals as well. Positive reinforcement with notifications for motivation to meet goals and acknowledgement and praise for meeting such goals in the app might be appealing to customers.\n3. The opportunity to set personal fitness goals as well as goals determined by CDC, NIH or other respectable medical research community may be included in the app. General health related information based on age, gender etc specific to the user provided on the app might generate interest as well.\n4. A calculator to add food consumed in order to determine caloric intake vs calories burned during the day as tracked through the Leaf will benefit users trying to maintain caloric intake or weight.\n5. Tracking sleep would benefit if the Leaf and app could also determine REM cycles. This may be possible if heart rate and respiratory rate can be measured along with the time the user falls asleep and wakes up. The user can track REM cycles and determine if they need to change their habits or environment to achieve better sleep. \n6. This data did not provide information on the gender and age of the users which could make a vast difference in the applicability of the analysis towards the target population of Bellabeat which is primarily women. Health and fitness requirements and habits of women may be different from men. Having any medical condition would also make a difference. Medical data of the sample population was also not provided.  \n\nOverall, there is a lot to learn from this data but results would be more reliable with a larger sample size and a longer duration of records.\n","metadata":{}}]}
